# Calcwiz Desktop

Calcwiz Desktop is a Tauri-based math workspace for textbook-style input, guarded symbolic solving, mode-specific workflows, stored numeric variables, and bounded exact-first algebra/calculus tools. It is already much more than a template calculator, while staying honest about its current scope: broad and useful, but still intentionally bounded rather than full CAS parity.

## Platform direction

Version 1 is now Linux-first for development and release sequencing. The project still preserves cross-platform ground through Tauri, React/TypeScript, Rust, and repo-owned validation so Windows and macOS remain viable targets rather than abandoned platforms.

## Why try it

- Desktop-first workflow with dedicated math workspaces instead of one overloaded input box
- Textbook-style math entry and rendering via MathLive
- Exact-first result handling, with clear approximate output, warnings, and condition/exclusion lines when needed
- Direct entry and guided builders living side by side
- Stored numeric variables with visible substitution policy and reproducible history snapshots
- A responsive editor analysis boundary with Run, Stop, and Restart Editor controls for heavy drafts
- Active, repo-owned validation with unit, UI, browser-smoke, lint, and Rust checks

## Current capabilities

These are grounded in the repository today.

### Core workspaces

- **Calculate**
  - Evaluate expressions
  - Simplify, factor, and expand
  - Use stored numeric values in standard evaluation with visible `Stored Values` details
  - Build and run core calculus workflows such as derivatives, integrals, and limits
  - Respect active/bound variables when stored values are present
- **Equation**
  - Solve symbolic equations in `x` and other explicit selected targets
  - Support explicit named targets such as `@mass` / `var(mass)` while raw adjacent letters remain multiplication
  - Preserve non-target symbols as symbolic parameters rather than silently substituting values
  - Cover many bounded selected-target families: affine/linear, quadratic, rational, factorable polynomial, carrier, exp/log, trig, composition, mixed algebraic, and same-argument mixed trig identities
  - Isolate one selected-target island through target-free algebraic shells before delegating to existing exact solver families
  - Solve guided quadratic, cubic, and quartic equations
  - Solve 2x2 and 3x3 linear systems
  - Use explicit interval-based numeric solving when symbolic solving stops short
  - Handle exclusions, branch/range facts, and conditions as visible result restrictions
- **Advanced Calc**
  - Advanced integral and limit workflows
  - Taylor and Maclaurin series workflows
  - First-order partial derivatives
  - ODE workflows, including numeric IVP handling
  - Stored-value adoption for safe non-bound parameters
- **Trigonometry**
  - Trig function evaluation
  - Bounded identity simplify/convert tools
  - Trig equation solving
  - Triangle-solving tools
  - Angle conversion and special-angle support
- **Geometry**
  - 2D shapes, 3D solids, triangles, circles, and coordinate geometry
  - Solve-for-missing workflows with explicit unknown markers
- **Statistics**
  - Dataset and frequency-table workflows
  - Descriptive statistics and frequency summaries
  - Binomial, normal, and Poisson workflows
  - One-sample mean inference
  - Regression and correlation with quality summaries
- **Matrix / Vector / Table**
  - Numeric matrix and vector operations
  - Notation pads for structured reuse
  - Function table generation with protected active variables and stored-value details
- **Variables**
  - Dedicated Variables side panel
  - Case-sensitive single-letter variables and explicit named variables
  - Finite real stored numeric values only
  - Insert, edit, clear, and clear-all controls
- **Guide**
  - In-app help, examples, and mode-specific guidance

## What already feels strong

- **Math-input UX**
  - The app is built around textbook-style input rather than plain text math commands.
- **Mode fidelity**
  - `Calculate` evaluates expressions.
  - `Equation` owns solving.
  - Geometry, Trigonometry, and Statistics keep their own guided workflows instead of collapsing back into one generic screen.
- **Guarded solving**
  - Symbolic solving is preferred when available.
  - Numeric solving is explicit rather than silently replacing exact work.
  - Domain conditions and exclusions are surfaced instead of hidden.
- **Variable clarity**
  - Solve targets, stored values, symbolic parameters, active variables, bound variables, reserved identifiers, and adjacent-letter ambiguity are classified and surfaced through hints/readback.
- **Responsive editor boundary**
  - Live hints, preview, target discovery, and transform eligibility are guarded for large drafts, with explicit Run/Stop/Restart Editor controls.
- **Shared workspace pattern**
  - Several domains use one top executable editor plus guided builders below it, which makes the app feel coherent instead of stitched together.

## Why this project is different

Calcwiz is not trying to be a thin shell around one expression engine. The repo already shows a more deliberate product direction:

- multiple math domains with dedicated workspaces
- explicit separation between exact and approximate results
- guided, typed workflows for geometry, trigonometry, and statistics
- an app-owned symbolic layer that supplements external symbolic tooling instead of pretending the external engine is the entire product
- explicit variable semantics and stored-value policy instead of silent global substitution
- internal exact-algebra substrates for future polynomial elimination and exact linear algebra work
- browser-first automation and repo-level validation as part of the development workflow

The result is a project that already feels like a serious math workbench, not just a Vite starter with calculator buttons attached.

## Tech stack / architecture snapshot

- **Frontend:** React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Desktop shell:** Tauri 2
- **Math input/rendering:** MathLive
- **Symbolic layer:** Compute Engine plus app-owned symbolic and solve modules
- **Persistence:** Tauri-backed calculator memory for settings, history, stored variables, and `Ans`, with browser preview fallback
- **Validation:** Vitest, Testing Library, Playwright, ESLint, `cargo check`

Architecture at a glance:

- `src/App.tsx` -> import shell
- `src/AppMain.tsx` -> runtime shell and orchestration
- `src/app/*` -> UI components, workspace views, and routing helpers
- `src/lib/modes/*` -> mode runners for Calculate, Equation, Matrix, Table, and Vector
- `src/lib/equation/*` -> guarded solving pipeline and equation logic
- `src/lib/algebra/*` -> variable, polynomial, rational, exact-matrix, and capability-readiness substrates
- `src/lib/kernel/*` -> capability, runtime-host, profile, policy, and envelope metadata
- `src/lib/symbolic-engine/*` -> app-owned symbolic normalization and rule layers
- `src/lib/{trigonometry,geometry,statistics,advanced-calc}/*` -> domain cores
- `src-tauri/*` -> desktop shell and Rust-side integration
- `e2e/*` -> browser smoke coverage

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm
- Rust toolchain
- Tauri system prerequisites for your platform

If you are setting up Tauri for the first time, use the official prerequisites guide:
- https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Run in browser dev mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Run the desktop app in development

```bash
npm run tauri:dev
```

The default desktop dev command disables Tauri's Rust file watcher and runs a Linux preflight that checks WebKitGTK plus inotify limits before Tauri starts. If the preflight reports low file-watch limits, run `npm run fix:linux-watch-limits` once on the host OS, reopen VS Code or close other watcher-heavy apps, then rerun `npm run tauri:dev`.

If you specifically need Rust hot reload and your OS watch limits can handle the repo, use:

```bash
npm run tauri:dev:watch
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run tauri:build
```

## Preview release

Calcwiz is preparing a Linux-first preview release path.

- Source builds are available now with the commands above.
- Packaged preview artifacts are produced by the `Release Linux` GitHub Actions workflow.
- The first public package should be treated as an early preview, not production-stable software or full CAS parity.
- Verify important mathematical results independently.

When a preview release is published, Linux artifacts will be available from GitHub Releases or from the `Release Linux` workflow artifacts.

Release checklist:
- [docs/release/first-public-preview-checklist.md](docs/release/first-public-preview-checklist.md)

Release process and notes:
- [docs/release/release-process.md](docs/release/release-process.md)
- [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

## Project pillars

Calcwiz keeps a small public pillars baseline for release confidence, correctness discipline, privacy expectations, dependency hygiene, and result-surface stability:
- [docs/pillars/README.md](docs/pillars/README.md)

## Validation / testing

The repo already includes multiple validation layers.

```bash
npm run test:unit
npm run test:ui
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:gate
```

`npm run test:gate` is the strongest single command. It runs:

- unit and contract tests
- jsdom-based UI integration tests
- browser smoke tests
- lint
- `cargo check`

## In active development

Calcwiz is real software today, but it is still actively expanding.

Current boundaries worth stating clearly:

- It is **not** claiming full Mathematica / Maple / industrial-grade CAS parity.
- Symbolic coverage is intentionally **bounded** and explicit.
- Stored values are numeric runtime substitutions, not symbolic assumptions, and Equation symbolic solving keeps targets/parameters symbolic.
- Raw multi-letter input is interpreted as adjacent-letter multiplication where parseable; one named variable requires explicit `@name` or `var(name)`.
- Matrix and Vector modes are numeric workspaces with notation pads, not full free-form symbolic matrix CAS.
- Browser-first automation is in place; desktop-shell-specific automation is still lighter than browser coverage.
- Some advanced algebra substrates are present internally, but product-facing polynomial systems, Grobner bases, broad inequality solving, complex-domain solving, graphing, and full CAS behavior are still future work.
