# Staged CAS Keyboard Activation Plan for Calcwiz

## Summary
Extend the calculator into a CAS-heavy product by replacing the current generic MathLive virtual keyboard with **custom milestone-gated keyboard layers**. Only the symbols and functions for the current milestone will be visible and active. Each milestone will close only when:
- the relevant keyboard pages are curated,
- the inserted symbols map to real behavior or intentionally-supported input semantics,
- duplicate/confusing symbols are resolved for that slice,
- and a **guided lesson** is delivered for you explaining what the new symbols mean and how to use them.

Locked decisions from this planning pass:
- Rollout strategy: `Core First`
- First functional slice: `Algebra Core`
- Keyboard policy: `Curated Active`
- Keyboard architecture: `Custom Layers`
- Milestone completion bar: `Behavior + Guide`
- User education format after each milestone: `Guided Lessons`

## Current Baseline
From the current repo and video review:

- The app uses `MathLive`, but **does not define custom virtual keyboard layouts**. The math field in [MathEditor.tsx](c:/Users/ahmed/Downloads/Cacluator/src/components/MathEditor.tsx) mounts with minimal configuration.
- The virtual keyboard shown in the recording is essentially the **default MathLive keyboard**, not a calculator-specific curated keyboard.
- The CAS engine in [math-engine.ts](c:/Users/ahmed/Downloads/Cacluator/src/lib/math-engine.ts) is still relatively narrow:
  - `simplify`
  - `factor`
  - `expand`
  - `evaluate`
  - `solve`
  - table evaluation
- The custom keypad in [menu.ts](c:/Users/ahmed/Downloads/Cacluator/src/lib/menu.ts) is still much smaller than the virtual keyboard.
- This creates a mismatch:
  - the virtual keyboard visually suggests many capabilities,
  - but many visible symbols are not yet backed by calculator workflows.
- Duplicate/confusing symbols currently come from default MathLive category organization, not from a curated product model.

This plan fixes that mismatch before broadly expanding CAS behavior.

## Product Direction
The calculator will treat the virtual keyboard as a **mode-aware CAS workspace**, not as a generic symbol dump.

Design rules:
- The appliance-style on-screen keypad remains the primary everyday keypad.
- The virtual keyboard becomes the **advanced math notation surface**.
- The virtual keyboard will no longer expose default MathLive pages wholesale.
- Each milestone unlocks only the relevant keyboard pages and symbols.
- Unsupported future symbols are **hidden**, not shown as dead weight.
- Similar symbols are separated by **meaning**, not just glyph:
  - `Σ` as a Greek letter belongs to letters/Greek
  - `∑` as a summation operator belongs to discrete math
- Alternate glyph variants are exposed through **variants/long-press**, not duplicate primary keys.

## Architecture Decisions

### Keyboard Model
Replace the current implicit/default keyboard with a custom keyboard registry.

Add these types:

```ts
export type CapabilityId =
  | 'keyboard-foundation'
  | 'algebra-core'
  | 'discrete-core'
  | 'calculus-core'
  | 'linear-algebra-core';

export type SupportLevel = 'hidden' | 'insert' | 'numeric' | 'symbolic';

export type KeyboardContext = {
  mode: ModeId;
  equationScreen?: EquationScreen;
  enabledCapabilities: CapabilityId[];
};

export type KeyboardAction =
  | { kind: 'insert-latex'; latex: string }
  | { kind: 'insert-template'; latex: string }
  | { kind: 'execute-command'; command: string }
  | { kind: 'open-page'; pageId: string };

export type KeyboardKeySpec = {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  action: KeyboardAction;
  capability: CapabilityId;
  supportLevel: SupportLevel;
  pageId: string;
  modeVisibility?: ModeId[];
  equationVisibility?: EquationScreen[];
  variants?: KeyboardKeySpec[];
  duplicateGroup?: string;
  lessonRef?: string;
};

export type KeyboardPageSpec = {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  capability: CapabilityId;
  rows: KeyboardKeySpec[][];
};

export type LessonSpec = {
  id: string;
  milestone: string;
  title: string;
  concepts: string[];
  examples: {
    title: string;
    steps: string[];
    expected: string;
  }[];
  pitfalls: string[];
};
```

### Keyboard Runtime Behavior
Implementation will use MathLive’s official virtual keyboard customization APIs:
- `mathVirtualKeyboard.layouts`
- custom layout/layer definitions
- key variants for alternate glyphs
- optional manual visibility control if needed

Official references:
- MathLive virtual keyboard guide: https://mathlive.io/mathfield/guides/virtual-keyboard
- MathLive virtual keyboard overview: https://mathlive.io/mathfield/virtual-keyboard/
- Mathfield API reference: https://mathlive.io/mathfield/api

### Duplicate Governance
Every symbol must belong to one of these categories:
- `primary visible key`
- `variant of another key`
- `hidden until later milestone`

Rules:
- No two primary keys with the same mathematical role may appear on the same page.
- Glyph variants like `ϵ/ε`, `φ/ϕ`, `θ/ϑ`, `ρ/ϱ`, `π/ϖ` must not consume multiple primary slots unless the milestone explicitly teaches both.
- Greek letter pages and operator pages must be separated by semantics, not just appearance.
- The summation operator `∑` must never be presented as a duplicate of Greek sigma `Σ`.

### No backend changes required initially
The first milestones should remain frontend- and TS-engine-driven.
No new Tauri commands are required for keyboard curation itself.

## Milestone Roadmap

## Milestone 0 — Keyboard Foundation and Curation
Purpose: replace the generic virtual keyboard with a controlled product keyboard before expanding CAS depth.

### Scope
- Replace default MathLive layouts with custom layers.
- Keep only milestone-backed pages visible.
- Add duplicate governance.
- Preserve current working editing ergonomics:
  - copy expression

  - paste
  - send result to editor
- Keep current custom calculator keypad intact.
- Add a compact “how to navigate the keyboard” lesson.

### Pages enabled
- `Core`
- `Letters`

- All visible algebra keys insert correct textbook templates.
- Every visible algebra key is either behavior-backed or intentionally variable-only.
- No duplicate algebra symbol clutter on primary pages.
- Lesson is complete and understandable for a novice user.

## Milestone 2 — Discrete Core
Purpose: activate the sum/product/combinatorics family that currently looks available but is not productized.

### Symbol governance for this milestone
- `∑` appears only on Discrete
- `Σ` remains a letter on Greek
- no duplicate “sum-like” primary symbols across pages

### User lesson deliverable
`docs/guides/milestone-02-discrete-core.md`

Lesson must explain:
- `Σ` vs `∑`
- `∏` vs multiplication
- factorial, permutations, combinations
- 5 worked examples with exact results
- domain restrictions and invalid-input cases

### Acceptance criteria
- Discrete keys are present only after the milestone.
- Sum/product templates include structured placeholders for index, lower bound, upper bound, and body.
- `∑` and `∏` behave numerically and predictably.
- `nCr`, `nPr`, `!` are exact and validated.
- Lesson clearly teaches the meaning of each new operator.

## Milestone 3 — Calculus Core
Purpose: make the calculator meaningfully CAS-heavy for derivatives, integrals, and limits.

### Pages enabled
- `Calculus`
- `Functions`
- plus prior milestone pages

### Symbols/functions active
- derivative `d/dx`
- derivative-at-point template
- indefinite integral

### CAS behavior required
- symbolic derivative where Compute Engine supports it
- numeric derivative at a point fallback if symbolic form is unavailable
- symbolic indefinite integral where supported
- numeric evaluation for definite integrals where symbolic result is unavailable
- limit support only for clearly supported cases; otherwise controlled message
- output must distinguish exact symbolic result from numeric approximation/fallback

### Explicitly out of scope for this milestone
- multivariable calculus
- Jacobians
- symbolic proof steps
- arbitrary advanced assumptions

### User lesson deliverable
`docs/guides/milestone-03-calculus-core.md`

Lesson must explain:

- symbolic vs numeric fallback expectations
- 5 worked examples, including one fallback example

### Acceptance criteria
- Calculus keys insert proper templates with placeholders.
- Supported cases solve reliably.
- Unsupported symbolic cases fail cleanly.
- Numeric fallback is clearly labeled.
- Lesson explains the operators in plain language.

## Milestone 4 — Linear Algebra Core
Purpose: activate matrix/vector notation in the math editor so keyboard capability matches existing matrix/vector app power.

### Pages enabled
- `MatrixVec`
- plus prior milestone pages

### Symbols/functions active
- matrix template
- vector template
- transpose
- determinant
- inverse
- dot product
- cross product
- norm

### CAS behavior required
- templates insert correctly in textbook notation
- integration with existing Matrix and Vector modes
- matrix/vector operations continue to work in their dedicated modes
- editor-side notation must not mislead the user into unsupported free-form matrix CAS if not yet implemented

### Governance rule
If a notation is editor-insertable but not fully free-form solvable, it must be clearly scoped to the relevant mode or documented as template-only.

### User lesson deliverable
`docs/guides/milestone-04-linear-algebra-core.md`

Lesson must explain:
- matrix vs vector entry
- determinant, inverse, transpose
- dot/cross/norm
- which tasks belong in `Matrix`/`Vector` modes versus free-form input

### Acceptance criteria
- Matrix/vector keyboard pages exist and are curated.
- Notation and dedicated-mode behavior are aligned.
- No duplicated matrix/vector operators across unrelated pages.
- Lesson clearly teaches when to use each operation.

## Keyboard Layout Policy

### Persistent design rules
- The virtual keyboard complements the calculator keypad; it does not replace it.
- Basic digits/operators stay on the calculator keypad and compact `Core` virtual page.
- Advanced notation lives on domain pages.
- Every page must fit a coherent mental model:
  - `Core`
  - `Algebra`
  - `Relations`
  - `Letters`
  - `Greek`
  - `Discrete`
  - `Combinatorics`
  - `Calculus`
  - `Functions`
  - `MatrixVec`

### Variant policy
Use variants for:
- alternate Greek glyphs
- alternate letter shapes
- rare notation tied to a main symbol

Do not use separate primary keys for variants unless:
- the milestone explicitly teaches both,
- and both have distinct practical use in the product.

### Mode-aware visibility
Keyboard pages should be filtered by context:
- `Calculate`: `Core`, active domain pages, letters/Greek as allowed
- `Equation`: `Core`, `Algebra`, `Relations`, later `Discrete`, `Calculus`
- `Matrix`: `Core`, `MatrixVec`
- `Vector`: `Core`, `MatrixVec`
- `Table`: `Core`, `Functions`, limited letters

## Data Flow

### On focus
When a math field gains focus:
1. Determine current mode and equation screen.
2. Determine active milestone capabilities.
3. Build the visible keyboard page list from the registry.
4. Set `mathVirtualKeyboard.layouts` to those custom layouts.

### On key press
A keyboard key does exactly one of:
- insert LaTeX
- insert a template
- execute an app command
- open another page/layer if needed

### On evaluation
The app evaluates only behavior-backed features for the current milestone.
Hidden future keys are absent, not teased.

### On unsupported expression
If a visible symbol produces an expression that is syntactically valid but beyond current CAS behavior:
- return a controlled message specific to the domain
- do not expose parser internals
- do not silently degrade into nonsense output

## Public Interface and Behavior Changes

### `MathEditor`
Update [MathEditor.tsx](c:/Users/ahmed/Downloads/Cacluator/src/components/MathEditor.tsx) so it:
- applies custom MathLive keyboard layouts on focus
- accepts per-context layout definitions
- optionally uses manual keyboard policy if that gives cleaner desktop behavior
- keeps smart fencing and structured insertion behavior

### Keyboard Registry
Create a single source of truth for:
- what symbols exist
- where they appear
- whether they are visible now
- whether they are insert-only, numeric, or symbolic
- which lesson explains them

### CAS Support Mapping
Each milestone must explicitly map keys to one of:
- `insert-only`
- `numeric`
- `symbolic`

That mapping must be testable and must prevent accidental symbol exposure without support.

## Test Cases and Scenarios

## Global tests
- default MathLive layouts are no longer visible
- only curated pages appear
- no duplicate primary keys within a page
- duplicate groups are enforced across active layouts
- page visibility changes correctly by mode and milestone
- copy/paste/edit ergonomics still work

## Milestone 0 tests
- `Σ` is on Greek only if intended as a letter
- `∑` is not visible yet
- `ε/ϵ` and similar pairs are variants, not duplicate keys
- focusing different math fields updates layouts appropriately

## Milestone 1 tests
- algebra templates insert valid textbook LaTeX
- `simplify`, `factor`, `expand`, `numeric` still work
- relations/operators display cleanly
- variable symbols act as variables, not malformed text
- exact vs numeric display remains correct

## Milestone 2 tests
- `∑_{k=1}^{5} k` evaluates correctly
- `∏_{k=1}^{4} k` evaluates correctly
- `5!`, `\binom{5}{2}`, and `nPr` forms return exact values
- invalid factorial/combinatorics inputs return controlled errors
- `Σ` and `∑` are not confused in the UI

## Milestone 3 tests
- derivative template inserts correctly
- supported symbolic derivatives work
- derivative-at-point numeric fallback works
- definite integral fallback works when symbolic result is unavailable
- limit errors are controlled and readable

## Milestone 4 tests
- matrix/vector templates insert correctly
- relevant operations still work in Matrix/Vector modes
- editor notation does not expose unsupported fake behavior

## Manual acceptance scenarios
- browse keyboard pages without seeing noisy duplicates
- enter an expression using only the virtual keyboard
- copy a result and send it back to an editor
- move from `Calculate` to `Equation` without keyboard confusion
- follow the guided lesson for the milestone and reproduce the examples successfully

## Guided Lesson Requirement After Every Milestone
Each milestone must end with a user-facing lesson written for a non-expert.

Required lesson structure:
1. What changed in this milestone
2. What each new symbol means
3. Where to find it on the keyboard
4. 3 to 5 worked examples
5. Common mistakes
6. Exact vs numeric expectations
7. Which modes are best for that symbol family

These lessons are part of the milestone definition, not optional documentation.

## Rollout Rules
- Never expose future-domain keys early.
- Never leave duplicate/confusing primary symbols on active pages.
- If a symbol is visible, it must be either:
  - behavior-backed for that milestone, or
  - intentionally variable/notation-only and explained in the lesson.
- A milestone is not complete until the lesson is delivered.

## Assumptions and Defaults
- The virtual keyboard remains visible on desktop and is part of the intended UX.
- Custom layers are preferred over filtering the default MathLive keyboard.
- Unsupported future symbols stay hidden rather than greyed out.
- Variants are accessed by long-press where useful.
- `Core` pages remain small and ergonomic; advanced CAS content moves to domain pages.
- The rollout order is:
  1. Keyboard Foundation
  2. Algebra Core
  3. Discrete Core
  4. Calculus Core
  5. Linear Algebra Core
- No backend/Rust changes are required to begin this roadmap.
- If a later milestone reveals Compute Engine limits, numeric fallback is acceptable where explicitly designed and clearly labeled.
