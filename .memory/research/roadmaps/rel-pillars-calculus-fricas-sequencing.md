# REL/PILLARS, Calculus Follow-Through, And FriCAS Context Sequencing

Status: sequencing memory and research-boundary capture only. This is not a product implementation milestone.

Recorded: 2026-04-27

## Source Context

- External planning note: `<local-source>/calcwiz_rel_pillars_roadmap.md`
- Live discussion: FriCAS should become a deep comparative context source, not a Calcwiz dependency or identity template.
- Current repo state: `REL0` is committed, `CALC-INT1` is complete, and Version 1 remains Linux-first.

## Clean-Base Priority

The next work should not jump directly back into math breadth or FriCAS research.

Preferred clean-base order:

1. `REL1` - first Linux preview release pipeline. Completed.
2. `PILLARS0` - minimal public-quality Calcwiz pillars baseline. Completed.
3. `MATH-GOLDEN0` - golden math regression corpus for shipped behavior. Completed.
4. `CALC-POLISH1` - calculus readback, Guide, history/replay, and UX consistency for the calculus core already established. Completed.
5. `INCUBATION-LABS0` - one-way generated Labs catalog and dev-only read-only experiment viewer. Completed.
6. `INCUBATION-SOURCES0` - controlled research-context source mirror registry. Completed.
7. `FRICAS-CTX0` - FriCAS architecture context atlas and reference corpora. Completed.
8. `DOCS0` / `TRIAGE0` / `SEC0` as public traffic pressure requires.

The broader `REL/PILLARS` roadmap remains the public-release hardening lane:

- `REL1`
- `PILLARS0`
- `MATH-GOLDEN0`
- `OBS0`
- `CONFIG0`
- `DOCS0`
- `TRIAGE0`
- `SEC0`
- `UX-REL0`

Not every item must block the first preview binary. `REL1`, `PILLARS0`, `MATH-GOLDEN0`, `CALC-POLISH1`, `INCUBATION-LABS0`, `INCUBATION-SOURCES0`, and `FRICAS-CTX0` are complete. The post-FriCAS native roadmap is now captured in `.memory/research/roadmaps/fricas-to-calcwiz-native-roadmap.md`; the recommended immediate next milestone is `ALG-CAPS0` unless public traffic makes `DOCS0`, `TRIAGE0`, `SEC0`, or another release-hardening slice more urgent.

## What Remains From The Calculus Core Roadmap

Completed calculus foundation:

- `CALC-AUDIT0`
- `CALC-CORE1`
- `CALC-CORE2`
- `CALC-CORE3`
- `CALC-COMP1`
- `CALC-DIFF1`
- `CALC-LIM1`
- `CALC-LIM2`
- `CALC-LIM3`
- `domain-range-CORE1`
- `CALC-INT1`
- `CALC-POLISH1`

Immediate remaining calculus follow-through:

- None currently locked. Future calculus work should be selected only after public-release pressure and the incubation-system strengthening lane are reviewed.

Parked or later calculus candidates:

- `CALC-COMP2`: mostly absorbed by `CALC-DIFF1`; reopen only for a concrete derivative readback/domain blocker.
- `CALC-SER1`: stronger series behavior after the current calculus surface is polished.
- `CALC-PARTIAL1`: partial derivative polish after single-variable calculus settles.
- `CALC-ODE1`: ODE UX and numeric IVP hardening after the main calculus lane is stable.
- `CALC-PLAY1`: speculative integration/search experiments in Playground only if bounded stable rules stop paying off.

## FriCAS Context Mirror Direction

Proposed lane name:

- `FRICAS-CTX0` - FriCAS Context Mirror And Research Boundary

Purpose:

- Study FriCAS as a high-power symbolic context source.
- Understand what enables broad symbolic capability.
- Translate only suitable ideas into Calcwiz-native, bounded, exact-first forms.

Hard boundaries:

- FriCAS is context, not authority.
- FriCAS must not become a Calcwiz runtime dependency.
- Do not import, call, build against, or submodule FriCAS in the stable product.
- Do not copy FriCAS code into Calcwiz by default.
- If code reuse is ever considered, stop and document exact source, license implications, why reuse is necessary, and why a Calcwiz-native rewrite is not preferred.
- FriCAS-inspired ideas must pass through the Playground/incubation ladder before stable adoption.
- Stable Calcwiz code must never depend on FriCAS-origin experimental code.

Preferred mirror shape:

- Keep all Calcwiz research-context clones under the controlled, ignored `playground/sources/mirrors/<mirror-id>/` paths.
- Commit only source mirror metadata under `playground/sources/metadata/`.
- Bring back only distilled research artifacts, benchmark/correctness corpora, and bounded experiment specs.
- Keep external clones out of Calcwiz git history and do not add source mirrors as submodules.

Registered context mirrors after `INCUBATION-SOURCES0`:

- FriCAS
- SymPy
- Maxima
- SageMath
- Giac / XCAS
- SymEngine

Candidate Calcwiz artifacts later:

- `.memory/research/source-context/fricas/fricas-context-memo.md`
- `.memory/research/source-context/fricas/fricas-capability-atlas.md`
- `.memory/research/source-context/fricas/fricas-calcwiz-fit-matrix.md`
- `.memory/research/source-context/fricas/fricas-idea-ledger.md`
- `.memory/research/roadmaps/fricas-to-calcwiz-native-roadmap.md`
- `playground/records/fricas-context-atlas.md`
- `playground/level-0-research/source-context/fricas-reference-corpus.ts`

Priority research outputs:

1. FriCAS context memo.
2. FriCAS capability atlas.
3. Calcwiz fit matrix.
4. Idea extraction ledger.
5. Top 10 research-to-prototype candidates.
6. First Playground incubation proposals.

Priority areas to study:

- polynomial algebra
- Groebner bases / regular chains / elimination
- symbolic integration / Risch-related capability
- assumptions, domains, and type behavior
- exact algebraic structures
- simplification / rewriting / normalization
- exact linear algebra / vectors / tensors
- series and special functions
- interpreter/type-system interplay
- package/domain architecture
- performance and representation choices

## Translation Rule

Every valuable FriCAS idea must be translated into a Calcwiz-native bounded form before it can be considered for adoption.

The default path is:

1. understand
2. analyze
3. restate
4. redesign
5. prototype in Playground if appropriate
6. adopt only by extraction into stable Calcwiz architecture

Do not optimize for imitation. Optimize for understanding, translation, and bounded extraction.

## Sequencing Decision

`FRICAS-CTX0` is valuable, but it should not interrupt the immediate public-release foundation lane.

Near-term priority:

1. finish `REL/PILLARS` clean-base work enough for public trust
2. complete the remaining calculus polish surface from the established calculus core
3. strengthen the Playground/incubation system itself before asking it to carry a large external-context lane
4. use the completed `INCUBATION-LABS0` one-way catalog/viewer pattern as the safe visual bridge for incubation status
5. use the completed `INCUBATION-SOURCES0` registry as the only controlled place for local context mirrors
6. start and keep FriCAS context research as an isolated, non-product comparative study

FriCAS should not be the pressure test for an unobserved incubation system. `INCUBATION-LABS0` now proves the one-way visual catalog pattern, and `INCUBATION-SOURCES0` now proves controlled source-mirror registration without cloning repos into git history. `FRICAS-CTX0` now provides the first context atlas, fit matrix, idea ledger, and reference corpus. The next recommended move is `ALG-CAPS0`, then polynomial readiness, integration candidate metadata, and bounded series/Grobner labs. Exact linear algebra is explicitly postponed behind `VEC-MAT-AUDIT0` because the current Matrix and Vector modes are numeric user workspaces plus notation pads, not reusable algebra cores.
