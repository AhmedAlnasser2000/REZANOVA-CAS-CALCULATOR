## Task Goal
- Implement `ARCH6A` as a pure transform-core extraction: move deterministic transform logic into one shared internal core without changing the public transform API, UI tray behavior, supplements, or runtime behavior.

## What Changed
- Added `src/lib/algebra/transform-core.ts` as the new shared internal transform substrate for:
  - transform action descriptors and labels
  - expression/equation source parsing
  - deterministic eligibility checks
  - exact transform application
  - normalized output comparison for materially-changed checks
  - shared per-side equation transform helpers and equation-structural routing
- Turned `src/lib/algebra-transform.ts` into a thin compatibility facade that preserves the existing public API:
  - `AlgebraTransformAction`
  - `AlgebraTransformResult`
  - `getAlgebraTransformLabel()`
  - `getEligibleExpressionTransforms()`
  - `applyExpressionTransform()`
  - `getEligibleEquationTransforms()`
  - `applyEquationTransform()`
- Centralized transform mechanics that had been duplicated or tightly coupled inside the old facade:
  - expression vs equation parsing
  - normalized latex comparison
  - transform action ordering
  - per-side equation application
  - shared source-guard behavior
- Added focused parity coverage in `src/lib/algebra/transform-core.test.ts`.
- Preserved public behavior across existing transform, mode, and UI coverage with no intentional transform-surface widening.

## Verification
- `npm run test:unit -- src/lib/algebra/transform-core.test.ts src/lib/algebra-transform.test.ts src/lib/modes/calculate.test.ts src/lib/modes/equation.test.ts`
- `npm run test:ui -- src/AppMain.ui.test.tsx`
- `npm run lint -- src/lib/algebra/transform-core.ts src/lib/algebra/transform-core.test.ts src/lib/algebra-transform.ts src/lib/algebra-transform.test.ts src/lib/modes/calculate.ts src/lib/modes/equation.ts src/AppMain.tsx src/app/logic/runtimeControllers.ts`
- `npm run test:gate`

## Verification Notes
- `ARCH6A` stayed parity-safe through the full gate. No transform-behavior regression or consumer import fallout was observed.

## Commits

## Follow-Ups
- Decide whether architecture should pause again now that `transform-core` is extracted, or whether branch-heavy roadmap pressure is high enough to justify a later `branch-core` extraction.
- Keep any future transform-product milestone separate from this extraction so `TRANSFORM1` does not get conflated with the behavior-preserving `ARCH6A` pass.
