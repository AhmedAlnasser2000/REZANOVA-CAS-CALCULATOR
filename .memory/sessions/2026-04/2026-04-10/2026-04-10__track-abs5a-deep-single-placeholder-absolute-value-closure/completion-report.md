## Task Goal
- Implement `ABS5A` as the capability slice for the next abs-lane step: reuse one normalized placeholder `t = |u|` across shipped non-periodic outer sinks, allow one more bounded outer non-periodic layer before branch-backsolve, and keep the existing single-abs branch model and exact-sink discipline intact.

## What Changed
- Extended `src/lib/algebra/abs-core.ts` so recognized abs equations can normalize one exact abs target to a reusable placeholder `t = |u|` and solve bounded outer non-periodic equations over `t` before returning to the existing abs sink path.
- Added outer non-periodic placeholder solving for:
  - logarithmic/inverse-style reductions
  - same-base exponential reductions
  - radical/root isolation
  - rational-power placeholder reductions
  - bounded linear and polynomial placeholder sinks
- Kept the abs lane bounded:
  - one exact abs target only
  - one extra non-periodic outer layer beyond the current `ABS4` surface
  - accepted placeholder roots must be real and satisfy `t >= 0`
  - all final branch candidates still validate against the original equation
- Preserved existing inner-sink reuse rules after `t` is solved:
  - explicit `x` closure remains preferred when available
  - existing exact reduced-carrier inner reuse is allowed only when already shipped
  - any branch that reaches only guided periodic/composition output keeps the whole abs family unresolved
- Strengthened branch-aware guidance for recognized outer non-periodic abs families with specific stop reasons for:
  - outer-depth cap
  - no admissible real nonnegative `t` values
  - outer reduction leaving the shipped exact sink set
  - downstream branches that reach only guided periodic/composition output
- Added focused coverage in:
  - `src/lib/algebra/abs-core.test.ts`
  - `src/lib/equation/shared-solve.test.ts`
  - `src/lib/equation/numeric-interval-solve.test.ts`
  - `src/lib/modes/equation.test.ts`
- Added a manual verification checklist at `.memory/research/checklists/2026-04/TRACK-ABS5A-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`.

## Verification
- `npm run test:unit -- src/lib/algebra/abs-core.test.ts src/lib/equation/shared-solve.test.ts src/lib/modes/equation.test.ts src/lib/equation/numeric-interval-solve.test.ts`
- `npm run lint -- src/lib/algebra/abs-core.ts src/lib/algebra/abs-core.test.ts src/lib/equation/shared-solve.test.ts src/lib/modes/equation.test.ts src/lib/equation/numeric-interval-solve.test.ts`
- `npm run test:gate`

## Verification Notes
- Focused ABS5A verification passed cleanly before the full gate run.
- The implementation intentionally leaves periodic outer families such as `\sin(|x|)=\frac{1}{2}` composition-owned; ABS5A does not claim that surface even though the overall app can still solve it through the composition lane.
- Generated Playwright `test-results/` output was removed after verification so the worktree reflects only source and durable-memory changes.

## Follow-Ups
- Decide whether the immediate follow-up should be `ABS5B` as the polish slice for the new outer non-periodic abs surface, or whether the roadmap should return to composition as `COMP13A`.
