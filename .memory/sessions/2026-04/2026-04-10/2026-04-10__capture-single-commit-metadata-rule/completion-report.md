## Task Goal
- Capture the workflow correction that commit metadata should be recorded within the same intended checkpoint instead of creating a second metadata-only commit afterward.

## What Changed
- Updated the authoritative workflow docs to state that commit metadata belongs in the same checkpoint whenever possible:
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `.memory/PROTOCOL.md`
  - `docs/workflow/commit-first-gates.md`
- Recorded the workflow decision in durable memory:
  - `.memory/decisions.md`
  - `.memory/journal/2026-04/2026-04-10.md`

## Verification
- Reviewed:
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `.memory/PROTOCOL.md`
  - `docs/workflow/commit-first-gates.md`

## Verification Notes
- This was a workflow-rule capture task only; no runtime behavior changed and no app test gate was required.

## Commits
- Not requested.

## Memory Updated
- `AGENTS.md`
- `.memory/PROTOCOL.md`
- `docs/workflow/commit-first-gates.md`
- `.memory/decisions.md`
- `.memory/journal/2026-04/2026-04-10.md`
- `.memory/sessions/2026-04/2026-04-10/2026-04-10__capture-single-commit-metadata-rule/completion-report.md`
- `.memory/sessions/2026-04/2026-04-10/2026-04-10__capture-single-commit-metadata-rule/verification-summary.md`
- `.memory/sessions/2026-04/2026-04-10/2026-04-10__capture-single-commit-metadata-rule/commit-log.md`

## Follow-Ups
- Future agents should update session commit metadata before or during the approved commit flow so the recorded hash lands in the same checkpoint whenever feasible.
