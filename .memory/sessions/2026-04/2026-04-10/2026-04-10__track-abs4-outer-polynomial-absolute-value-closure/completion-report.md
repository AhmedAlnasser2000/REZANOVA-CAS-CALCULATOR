## Task Goal
- Implement `ABS4` as the next abs-lane product milestone: keep the shared `u=\pm v` branch model fixed, add bounded one-placeholder outer-polynomial closure `P(|u|)=0`, and reuse already-shipped trig/composition sinks only when each generated abs branch still lands in bounded exact closure.

## What Changed
- Extended `src/lib/abs-core.ts` so the shared abs substrate now:
  - recognizes direct versus outer-polynomial absolute-value normalization
  - solves bounded exact placeholder roots for `t = |u|` on the existing polynomial surface
  - filters placeholder roots to real nonnegative values before routing them back into the existing abs family path
  - emits stronger unresolved metadata for outer-polynomial failure, empty admissible branch sets, and branch-sink failures
- Extended `src/lib/equation/guarded/algebra-stage.ts` so the guarded abs lane now:
  - accepts recognized outer-polynomial abs families even when no exact branch equations survive immediately
  - returns family-specific empty-branch errors when the shared abs core recognizes the family but no admissible branches remain
  - blocks partial exact merge when a generated abs branch only lands in guided periodic/composition output instead of an already-shipped exact sink
- Locked the milestone with focused ABS4 regression coverage in:
  - `src/lib/abs-core.test.ts`
  - `src/lib/equation/numeric-interval-solve.test.ts`
  - `src/lib/equation/shared-solve.test.ts`
  - `src/lib/modes/equation.test.ts`
- Added a manual verification checklist at `.memory/research/TRACK-ABS4-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`.

## Verification
- `npm run test:unit -- src/lib/equation/numeric-interval-solve.test.ts src/lib/equation/shared-solve.test.ts src/lib/modes/equation.test.ts src/lib/abs-core.test.ts`
- `npm run lint -- src/lib/abs-core.ts src/lib/abs-core.test.ts src/lib/equation/guarded/algebra-stage.ts src/lib/equation/shared-solve.test.ts src/lib/equation/numeric-interval-solve.test.ts src/lib/modes/equation.test.ts`
- `npm run test:gate`

## Verification Notes
- `ABS4` closed cleanly under the shared abs/branch substrate. The main correctness guard added in this pass is that a recognized outer-polynomial abs family no longer reports a partial exact success when one of its generated branches only reaches guided periodic/composition output.

## Commits
- Recorded in repository history as the same ABS4 checkpoint that updated this dossier.

## Follow-Ups
- Decide whether the next algebra step should stay in the abs lane as `ABS5` or return to the composition lane now that bounded outer-polynomial abs closure and bounded trig/composition reuse share the same branch model cleanly.
