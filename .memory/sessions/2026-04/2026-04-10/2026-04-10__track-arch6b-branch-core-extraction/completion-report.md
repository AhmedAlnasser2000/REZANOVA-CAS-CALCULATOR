## Task Goal
- Implement `ARCH6B` as a pure branch-core extraction: centralize shared bounded branch/case bookkeeping across abs families, periodic/principal-range metadata, and simple rewrite/substitution branch-array producers without changing public types, solver behavior, or UI output.

## What Changed
- Added `src/lib/algebra/branch-core.ts` as the new shared internal branch substrate for:
  - normalized branch equation sets
  - branch-constraint merging
  - two-branch tuple adapters for rewrite-style producers
  - periodic/principal-range metadata normalization and merge helpers
- Rewired the deepest branch-heavy lanes to use that internal core:
  - `src/lib/algebra/abs-core.ts`
  - `src/lib/equation/composition-stage.ts`
  - `src/lib/equation/guarded/merge.ts`
- Rewired lighter branch-array producers and consumers through the same helpers while keeping their public result unions stable:
  - trig rewrite split producers in `src/lib/trigonometry/rewrite/*`
  - guarded trig-rewrite consumption in `src/lib/equation/guarded/rewrite-trig-stage.ts`
  - substitution producers in `src/lib/equation/substitution/*`
  - guarded substitution/algebra consumers in `src/lib/equation/guarded/*`
- Added focused parity coverage in `src/lib/algebra/branch-core.test.ts`.
- Preserved public/result-facing behavior:
  - no `DisplayOutcome` changes
  - no `PeriodicFamilyInfo` changes
  - no `AbsoluteValueEquationFamily` changes
  - no trig rewrite or substitution public union changes
  - no intentional solver, badge, supplement, or UI behavior change

## Verification
- `npm run test:unit -- src/lib/algebra/branch-core.test.ts src/lib/algebra/abs-core.test.ts src/lib/trigonometry/rewrite-solve.test.ts src/lib/equation/shared-solve.test.ts src/lib/equation/guarded-solve.test.ts src/lib/modes/equation.test.ts`
- `npm run lint -- src/lib/algebra/branch-core.ts src/lib/algebra/branch-core.test.ts src/lib/algebra/abs-core.ts src/lib/equation/guarded/merge.ts src/lib/equation/composition-stage.ts src/lib/equation/guarded/rewrite-trig-stage.ts src/lib/equation/guarded/substitution-stage.ts src/lib/equation/guarded/algebra-stage.ts src/lib/trigonometry/rewrite/square-split.ts src/lib/trigonometry/rewrite/sum-product.ts src/lib/equation/substitution/trig-polynomial.ts src/lib/equation/substitution/inverse-isolation.ts src/lib/equation/substitution/log-combine.ts src/lib/equation/substitution/exp-polynomial.ts src/lib/equation/substitution/same-base-equality.ts`
- `npm run test:gate`

## Verification Notes
- `ARCH6B` stayed parity-safe through the full gate. The new core reduced duplicated branch bookkeeping without changing public solver or UI behavior.

## Follow-Ups
- Decide whether architecture should pause again now that both `transform-core` and `branch-core` are extracted, or whether a later thin algebra registry is worth considering only if orchestration pressure becomes real.
- Keep any future branch/product milestone separate from this parity-safe extraction so later abs/composition breadth work is not conflated with `ARCH6B`.
