## Task Goal
- Implement `COMP12A` as the capability slice for the next composition milestone: broaden exact reduced-carrier periodic and sawtooth closure from reduced polynomial carriers into already-shipped bounded single-family carriers while keeping explicit `x` closure preferred and mixed poly-rad carriers out of scope.

## What Changed
- Extended `src/lib/equation/composition-stage.ts` with an admitted reduced-carrier matcher for already-shipped bounded single-family carriers:
  - abs-backed carriers
  - supported radical carriers
  - supported rational-power carriers
  - selected shifted logarithmic carriers
- Kept the new matcher behind the existing explicit-`x` carrier paths, so current affine/power/quadratic/log/exponential continuations still solve back to `x` when that bounded path already exists.
- Reused the same periodic/sawtooth infrastructure for the new reduced-carrier exact wins instead of adding a new solver lane or changing current depth/parameter caps.
- Added focused regression coverage in:
  - `src/lib/equation/guarded-solve.test.ts`
  - `src/lib/modes/equation.test.ts`
  - `src/AppMain.ui.test.tsx`
- Added a manual verification checklist at `.memory/research/checklists/2026-04/2026-04-10/TRACK-COMP12A-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`.

## Verification
- `npm run test:unit -- src/lib/equation/guarded-solve.test.ts src/lib/modes/equation.test.ts`
- `npm run test:ui -- src/AppMain.ui.test.tsx`
- `npm run lint -- src/lib/equation/composition-stage.ts src/lib/equation/guarded-solve.test.ts src/lib/modes/equation.test.ts src/AppMain.ui.test.tsx`
- `npm run test:memory-protocol`
- `npm run test:gate`

## Verification Notes
- The key behavioral guard in this pass is that admitted reduced-carrier exact families are only accepted after the existing explicit-`x` continuations decline to close, which keeps `COMP12A` as a carrier-breadth milestone instead of a priority inversion over earlier bounded solves.

## Follow-Ups
- Decide whether the immediate next step should be `COMP12B` as the polish/trust/readback slice for the new reduced-carrier composition surface, or `ABS5A` as the next abs capability slice.
