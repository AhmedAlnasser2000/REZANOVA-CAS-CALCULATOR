## Task Goal
- Implement `ABS2` as the broader bounded abs-family and branch-aware numeric-guidance milestone on top of `ABS1`: widen direct and transform-produced abs recognition without changing the core two-branch model or introducing a general piecewise engine.

## What Changed
- Extended `src/lib/abs-core.ts` and `src/types/calculator/abs-types.ts` so the shared abs substrate now:
  - preserves exact outer scalar coefficients around abs targets
  - recognizes affine-wrapped direct families such as `a|u|+b=c`, `a|u|+b=v`, and `a|u|+b=|v|`
  - rejects direct nested-abs towers and sum-of-unrelated-abs families instead of normalizing them into unsupported search paths
- Rewired `src/lib/equation/guarded/algebra-stage.ts` so direct input and transform-produced perfect-square collapses both reuse the broader wrapped-abs normalization path, including cases like `\sqrt{(x+1)^2}+1=6`.
- Preserved the same bounded `u=\pm v` branch model from `ABS1`; exact closure still proceeds only when every generated branch lands in already-shipped bounded sinks and then survives original-equation validation.
- Strengthened `src/lib/equation/numeric-interval-solve.ts` so recognized but unresolved wrapped abs families now report:
  - recognized-family-but-no-exact-closure guidance
  - missed-all-branches interval guidance
  - one-admissible-branch interval guidance
  - normalized nonnegativity-side guidance when the comparison side cannot satisfy the preserved sign condition
- Kept `Calculate > Simplify` narrow in `src/lib/math-engine.ts` while broadening canonical direct abs normalization/readback through the same shared core.
- Added or updated focused coverage in:
  - `src/lib/abs-core.test.ts`
  - `src/lib/equation/shared-solve.test.ts`
  - `src/lib/equation/numeric-interval-solve.test.ts`
  - `src/lib/modes/equation.test.ts`
  - `src/lib/math-engine.test.ts`
- Added a manual app verification checklist at `.memory/research/TRACK-ABS2-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`.

## Verification
- `npm run test:memory-protocol`
- `npm run test:gate`

## Verification Notes
- `npm run test:gate` completed cleanly for this milestone, so no abs-specific blocker or recorded flake is currently attached to `ABS2`.

## Follow-Ups
- Decide whether the next algebra milestone should stay in the abs lane as `ABS3` or return to the composition lane.
- If we stay in the abs lane, keep the next step broader rather than deeper: more bounded wrappers/carriers on top of the same branch model, not nested abs or general piecewise search.
