## Task Goal
- Capture the detailed architecture boundary between future `transform-core` and `branch-core` extractions, and save the stronger repo guidance in durable memory.

## What Changed
- Added a detailed architecture note at `.memory/research/TRANSFORM-CORE-VS-BRANCH-CORE-BOUNDARY-MAP.md`.
- Recorded the refined doctrine in durable memory:
  - `transform-core` and `branch-core` should stay separate algebra cores
  - `branch-core` is preferred over `piecewise-core` unless broader piecewise algebra becomes a real product commitment
  - default extraction preference is `transform-core` first because it is lower-risk
  - branch-heavy roadmap pressure is the valid reason to reverse that order
- Updated:
  - `.memory/current-state.md`
  - `.memory/decisions.md`
  - `.memory/open-questions.md`
  - `.memory/journal/2026-04/2026-04-10.md`

## Verification
- Reviewed current transform and branch-heavy surfaces in:
  - `src/lib/algebra-transform.ts`
  - `src/lib/abs-core.ts`
  - `src/lib/equation/guarded/algebra-stage.ts`
  - `src/types/calculator/display-types.ts`

## Verification Notes
- This was an architecture-direction capture task only; no runtime behavior changed and no app test gate was required.
- The purpose was to save the refined boundary map, not to trigger an immediate extraction.

## Commits
- Not requested.

## Follow-Ups
- If architecture resumes later, decide whether actual roadmap pressure is transform-heavy or branch-heavy before choosing the first extraction.
