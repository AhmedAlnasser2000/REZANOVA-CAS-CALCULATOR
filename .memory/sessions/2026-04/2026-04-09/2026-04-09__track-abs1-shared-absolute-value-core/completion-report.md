## Task Goal
- Implement `ABS1` as a shared absolute-value core and bounded abs-solving milestone: create one reusable abs substrate for symbolic and numeric paths, keep the visible exact surface bounded to deterministic branch families, and preserve trust/supplement discipline.

## What Changed
- Added `src/lib/algebra/abs-core.ts` and `src/types/calculator/abs-types.ts` as the shared abs-core layer for:
  - direct abs-family recognition
  - canonical bounded abs normalization
  - branch generation for `|u|=c`, `|u|=v`, and `|u|=|v|`
  - nonnegativity/domain constraint extraction
  - branch-aware numeric follow-up metadata
- Rewired `src/lib/equation/guarded/algebra-stage.ts` so direct abs equalities and transform-produced abs follow-ons such as `\sqrt{(u)^2}` now share one bounded branch path instead of keeping radical-to-abs logic as a narrow special case.
- Rewired `src/lib/equation/numeric-interval-solve.ts` so recognized direct abs families now return stronger interval guidance when:
  - exact bounded closure is unavailable
  - the interval misses all admissible branches
  - only one admissible branch is relevant
- Rewired `src/lib/math-engine.ts` so `Calculate > Simplify` reuses the shared abs core for bounded exact abs normalization while keeping `Factor` unchanged.
- Added and updated coverage in:
  - `src/lib/algebra/abs-core.test.ts`
  - `src/lib/equation/shared-solve.test.ts`
  - `src/lib/equation/numeric-interval-solve.test.ts`
  - `src/lib/math-engine.test.ts`
  - `src/lib/modes/equation.test.ts`
  - `src/types/calculator/runtime-contracts.test.ts`
- Added a manual app verification checklist at `.memory/research/checklists/2026-04/TRACK-ABS1-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`.

## Verification
- `npm run test:memory-protocol`
- `npm run test:unit`
- `npm run lint`
- `npx playwright test e2e/qa1-smoke.spec.ts --project=chromium --grep "COMP5 smoke keeps deep nested periodic carriers on structured multi-parameter guidance"`

## Verification Notes
- `npm run test:gate` was attempted and reached the existing Playwright `COMP5` smoke flake on the side-surface overlay backdrop click in `e2e/qa1-smoke.spec.ts`.
- The immediate targeted rerun of that same smoke passed, so the recorded blocker is an existing browser-interaction flake rather than an `ABS1` regression.
- A standalone `npm run test:unit` attempt also hit two existing long-running decimal-root tests on timeout once, but the same suite completed green when rerun inside the broader gate flow.

## Follow-Ups
- Decide whether the next algebra step should stay in the abs lane as `ABS2` or return to a neighboring bounded factor/transform milestone.
- If the flaky `COMP5` overlay-backdrop interaction keeps reappearing in `test:gate`, isolate it as a separate UI-stability fix rather than treating it as algebra-mileage debt.
