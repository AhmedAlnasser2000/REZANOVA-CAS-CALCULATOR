## Scope
- affine-wrapped direct abs-family recognition
- transform-produced wrapped abs follow-ons
- branch-aware numeric interval guidance for recognized abs families
- simplify-side direct abs canonicalization through the shared core

## Commands
- `npm run test:memory-protocol`
- `npm run test:gate`

## Manual Checks
- Confirmed `|2x-3|+1=6` solves exactly through the broader wrapped-abs direct path.
- Confirmed `2|x+1|-3=x` keeps bounded branch conditions and validates candidates against the original equation.
- Confirmed `3|2x-1|+4=|x+5|` reduces through the same shared wrapped-abs branch logic instead of a feature-local path.
- Confirmed `\sqrt{(x+1)^2}+1=6` now closes through the transform-produced wrapped abs bridge and returns both valid branches.
- Confirmed `|x^2+1|+1=e^x` is recognized for guidance but still stops honestly when a generated branch would require unsupported follow-on depth.
- Confirmed `||x+1||` normalizes to `|x+1|` and `\sqrt{x^2+2x+1}` still simplifies to `|x+1|`.

## Outcome
- Passed.

## Outstanding Gaps
- None recorded for `ABS2`; nested abs towers, abs inequalities, and sums of unrelated abs terms remain intentionally out of scope.
