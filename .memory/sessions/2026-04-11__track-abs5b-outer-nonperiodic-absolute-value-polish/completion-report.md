## Task Goal
- Implement `ABS5B` as the polish slice for `ABS5A`: keep the new outer-nonperiodic abs capability surface unchanged while making exact readback, guided-stop explanations, branch-aware numeric guidance, and result-card rendering feel deliberate and non-duplicative.

## What Changed
- Polished `src/lib/abs-core.ts` so outer-nonperiodic abs exact wins now emit:
  - one short canonical solve summary
  - stable `t = |u|` reduction readback
  - compact detail sections for reduction context, generated branches, and exact-closure boundaries
- Kept the `ABS5A` exact/guided boundary unchanged while sharpening unresolved wording for:
  - outer non-periodic depth-cap stops
  - empty admissible `t >= 0` outcomes
  - outer reductions that leave the current exact sink set
  - downstream branches that reach only guided periodic/composition output
  - mixed multi-family / multi-abs surfaces outside the single-placeholder abs contract
- Updated `src/lib/equation/guarded/algebra-stage.ts` so outer-nonperiodic abs transforms attach ABS5B detail sections through the existing `DisplayOutcome.detailSections` surface without introducing an abs-only public card type.
- Kept `src/AppMain.tsx` on the existing generic detail-section rendering path; exact abs context now reads separately from periodic-family and closure-boundary messaging without new UI primitives.
- Improved branch-aware numeric guidance wording so recognized outer-nonperiodic abs families now reuse their `t = |u|` context and make single-branch vs no-branch interval misses clearer.
- Fixed two readback issues during verification:
  - preserved raw `|sin(...)|` placeholder context instead of simplified `sin(|...|)` readback
  - normalized decimalized branch constants such as `0.500000...` back into simple exact inline fractions in abs branch details
- Added a manual verification checklist at `.memory/research/TRACK-ABS5B-MANUAL-VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md`.

## Verification
- `npm run test:unit -- src/lib/abs-core.test.ts src/lib/equation/shared-solve.test.ts src/lib/modes/equation.test.ts src/lib/equation/numeric-interval-solve.test.ts`
- `npm run test:ui -- src/AppMain.ui.test.tsx`
- `npm run lint -- src/lib/abs-core.ts src/lib/abs-core.test.ts src/lib/equation/guarded/algebra-stage.ts src/lib/equation/shared-solve.test.ts src/lib/modes/equation.test.ts src/lib/equation/numeric-interval-solve.test.ts src/AppMain.ui.test.tsx`
- `npm run test:memory-protocol`
- `npm run test:gate`

## Verification Notes
- Focused ABS5B tests initially exposed three polish-only issues:
  - extra spacing inside inline absolute-value readback
  - compute-engine simplification rewriting `|sin(...)|` into `sin(|...|)` in the placeholder summary path
  - decimalized generated-branch constants like `0.500000...` reading worse than simple exact fractions
- All three were fixed in the readback layer without widening the solve surface, and the full gate passed afterward.

## Follow-Ups
- Decide whether the next capability slice should return to composition as `COMP13A` or stay in the abs lane for a new `ABS6A`.
